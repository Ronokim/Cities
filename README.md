# Cities

## About

This is a Swift codebase displaying about 200k cities

## Prerequisites

* A Mac with [Xcode 10](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (or later) installed is required to build and test this project.

## Setup Steps

1. Clone this sample code repository
1. Test the app in the Simulator (from the Product menu in Xcode)


## How It Works

* Upon launch, the app reads a large json file containing 200k records and it may take a while on launch.

* Users can be able to scroll or search for a particular  city.

* On selecting a city, it will be shown on a map in a seperate screen


## Note

* Code is not stable, still being refactored.

* Test cases not comprehensive, and needs refactoring
